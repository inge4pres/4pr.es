### __4pr.es__
## A URL shortener in Go

[4pres](https://4pr.es/) is yet another URL shortener, it will give you a short link for a long URL.

It is written in 120 lines of [Go](http://golang.org/) and it uses the powerful [go-martini](https://github.com/go-martini) web framework and the beautiful [basscss](http://www.basscss.com/) as CSS style.

Shortened URLs have no expiration, for now :D
