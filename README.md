### __s.4pr.es__
## A URL shortener in Go

[s4pres](https://s.4pr.es/) is yet another URL shortener, it will give you a short link for a long URL.
It is written in 120 lines of [Go](http://golang.org/) and it uses the powerful [go-martini](https://github.com/go-martini) web framework.
Shortened URLs have no expiration, for now :D
